# hearchallenge

My solution for this coding challenge included creating a basic landing page with header, subheader, hero image, 50 word text description, date of 26th for previous month, stacked images using flexbox, list of 10 objects, and a form. The page can toggle between english and spanish by clicking a link at the top. The site is responsive and mobile friendly.

To accomplish this task, I created two html files (one for each language), a css file, and a js file. The date and headers are dynamic and are determined off parameters listed in the js file.

You can find a live link to the site here: https://robbiesanchez.github.io/hearchallenge/index.html

Please reach out with any questions.

Thank you!
